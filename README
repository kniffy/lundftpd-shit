hello, the basic instructions are to do the following:

./configure

then,

make

from there you are smart enough to figure things out :)

	DIRECTORY LISTING:
in lftp it seems that by default dirlists are out of order!
so here is some documentation on what list options exist

	-N	sort by name
	-r	reverse sort
	-R	recursive sort (says disabled in code comments)
	-t	sort by date
	-S	sort by size
	-a	"show dot" mode
	-X	xml output mode
	-1	"short" list?
	-I	sort by case
	-D	sort with directories first
	-W	show dirsize (but thats already in lists?)
	-G	show genre (??)

obviously, to use these you simply edit your client's config
eg in lftp:
	set ftp:list-options "-N"

or, if you need a sane global option with a fix just for a
lundftpd site:
	set ftp:list-options "-la"
	set ftp:list-options/example.com "-N"
